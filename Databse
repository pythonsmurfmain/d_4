The atom is mostly empty space: Rutherford's experiments showed that atoms are mostly empty space with a tiny, dense nucleus at the center.\n2. Nucleus: The nucleus contains positively charged protons and uncharged neutrons, which account for most of the atom's mass.\n3. Electrons orbit the nucleus: Electrons, negatively charged particles, orbit the nucleus in various energy levels or electron shells.\n4. Electrons are distributed in space: Electrons occupy specific energy levels, which are at varying distances from the nucleus, and they move in these energy levels.\n\nThe Rutherford model replaced the previous "plum pudding" model and laid the foundation for our modern understanding of atomic structure."

    "J.J. Thomson's model of the atom, proposed in the late 19th century, is often referred to as the 'plum pudding' or 'raisin bun' model. According to this model, the atom is composed of a positively charged 'pudding' with electrons, represented as 'raisins,' embedded within it. In other words, electrons are distributed throughout a positively charged sphere. This model helped advance our understanding of atomic structure and laid the foundation for later atomic models."

Electrons orbit the nucleus in specific energy levels or shells.\n2. Electrons in the innermost shell have the lowest energy, while those in outer shells have higher energy levels.\n3. Electrons can jump between energy levels by absorbing or emitting energy in the form of photons.\n4. Electrons are most stable when they occupy the lowest energy level.\n\nThe Bohr-Bury model provided a better understanding of the behavior of electrons within atoms and laid the foundation for modern atomic theory."
